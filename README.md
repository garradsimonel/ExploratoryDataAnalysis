# ExploratoryDataAnalysis-
Contains .ipynb files of EDA on various datasets

This file contains all the code along with the Inference for the Exploratory Data Analysis on the Bike Rental System.
The Bike Rental System Dataset has a data points of rents of cycles per hour for the years 2011 and 2012.
I have attempted to understand the Key motivations for the rents of the cycle and to identify any patterns if they exist.
The Data set originally contains no missing values, however after outlier analysis, a simple missing value treatment was implemented.
